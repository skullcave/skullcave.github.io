  For my first post, I will discuss the time I was almost scammed and we will also look at how to identify misleading emails.<br><br>
  
First, let's talk about how I found myself in this position and how I responded to it. On October 7th 2023, I was emailed by an "HR Team" member with the company 'Avalon Flooring' in regards to a job position titled Network Administrator. I thought great! I was in the process of applying to IT / Cybersecurity related jobs, and I sent out many applications during this period of time. The initial e-mail seemed legit from the jump; it had a solid sounding e-mail name 'edward@avalonflooringrecruit.com' and had a company logo in the signature. Being the expert that I am in this industry <em>&#42;sarcasm&#42;</em> I should have caught this. Below is a screenshot of the first e-mail that reeled me in.

In the red rectangles you will see both the e-mail name and the signature of the e-mail. At a quick glance this all seems normal but upon further inspection something seems fishy. It simply states "HR Team". Typically employees of companies will list their position title along with what departement they work in within the company. If I had caught this sooner, I might have raise some alarm bells in my head. Regardless, lets see how this e-mail chain progresses.

This attachment was a PDF file that required you to fill out your name and then answer a series of questions pertaing to computer networking. Some of these questions required the candidate to explain which tools to support remote troubleshooting and how to handle network scalability to name a few. In this same document it further stated the work scheudle, benefits and the pay range for this posotion. So of course, I answered the questions the best I could with the knowledge I had relating to computer networking. Here was their response.

This is the best part of the scam, the wait. It took two days to hear back from the "recruiter" and this is what made feel like this was legit. We have all been there, waiting on edge to see if we progressed in the hiring process, espcially a remote job with lucrative pay. However, the contents within this final e-mail is what raised the alarm.

<div class="post-image-container">
    <img class="post-image" src="/assets/posts/scam-four.png" alt="fourth screenshot of scam">
  </div>

In this fourth and final e-mail, I have highlighted the key indicators of this being a fradulent job offer. First, 60 USD an hour is quite a lot of money and in my expierence amounts like this are usually discussed during virtual or in person interview. Secondly, a user ID and password will be given to a new employee after 5 days?? This seems a little odd to me because there usually an onbaording process as well as allowing more time to pass before given new employees sensitve credentials. Thirdly and most imporatnt is the check they were going to send me. This is the most important part of the scame because this is how their profit. <br><br>

According to the FTC (2022) "in a fake check scam, a person you donâ€™t know asks you to deposit a check". In the red rectangle we will see that this indivudial is asking for my full complete name, full mailing address, and further contact information such as my phone number. I believe that this information this information would have been used to generate a fake check that would then be mailed directly to me. At this point in the scam, the scammer will then ask for money back from the victim. Often times the scammer will ask for this in the form of a gift card.
