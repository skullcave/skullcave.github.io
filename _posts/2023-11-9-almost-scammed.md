    For my first post, I will discuss the time I was almost scammed and we will also look at how to identify misleading emails.<br><br>
    First, let's talk about how I find myself in this position and respond to it. On October 7th, I was emailed by an "HR Team" member with the company 'Avalon Flooring' in regards to a job position of Network Administrator. I thought great! I was in the process of applying to IT / Cybersecurity related jobs, and I sent out many applications during this period of time. The initial e-mail seemed legit from the jump; it had a solid sounding domain name 'edward@avalonflooringrecruit.com' and had a company logo in the signature. Being the expert that I am in this industry <em>&#42;sarcasm&#42;</em> I should have caught this. Below is a screenshot of the first e-mail that reeled me in.
